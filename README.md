This application requires a low level assembly language to represent the logic of the machine you want to run. Given such a language, the application will then ask for a word to analyze. After receiving the word, the application will then determine if it is accepted by the input machine language. An example language that spans over the set {1,0, #} has been provided for quick usage.
